GOAL:
Design a home IoT system with easily deployable, battery-powered sensor nodes that will 
detect passerbys in each room of the house in order to unwarrented activity in the house. Because we are using ultrasnoic sensors, 
users will not need to install into walls making it easier to use...

See the attached picture diagram for further information.
